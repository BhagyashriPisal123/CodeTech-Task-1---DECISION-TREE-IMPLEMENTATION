##DESCRIPTION OF DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION TASK : - Tools and Libraries Used- Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation. Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle the dataset. NumPy: A library for numerical computations, used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for model training, evaluation, and metrics. load_iris: A function to load the Iris dataset. DecisionTreeClassifier: The machine learning model used for classification. train_test_split: A function to split the dataset into training and testing sets. export_text: A function to export the decision tree rules in a textual format. plot_tree: A function to visualize the decision tree. Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data. Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.Google Colab: An online interactive environment that allows writing and executing Python code in the browser. It supports collaborative development, access to powerful hardware (GPUs), and is well-suited for machine learning and data analysis tasks. *Task Applicability- Classification Problems: Decision Trees can be applied to various classification problems in different domains, such as healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (credit scoring), and marketing (customer segmentation). Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding which features contribute most to the predictions can help in feature selection and improving model performance. Decision Support Systems: Decision Trees can be used in systems that require clear decision-making processes, such as loan approval systems or medical diagnosis tools. Data Exploration: The visual nature of Decision Trees makes them useful for exploratory data analysis, allowing stakeholders to understand the decision-making process of the model.
